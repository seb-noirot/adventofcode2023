# Advent of Code with Go 🚀

## Overview 📚

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, written in Go 🐹. The primary purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of Go and to hone my skills in various programming practices including Test-Driven Development (TDD) 🧪, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏗️, and other industry-standard best practices.

## Objectives 🎯

- **Learn and Master Go:** Utilize Go's powerful features and idiomatic practices to solve complex problems 🧠.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Embrace TDD to ensure robust and reliable code solutions 🔍.
- **Object-Oriented Principles:** Apply OO principles in Go to design clean, modular, and scalable code 📦.
- **Best Practices:** Follow coding best practices and continually improve code quality ✨.

## Project Structure 📂

This repository is organized to reflect my journey through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, with a focus on learning and mastering Go. Here's how the project is structured:

- Each day's challenge is encapsulated within its own package, named `day1`, `day2`, and so on.
- Inside each package, you'll find the following files:
  - `dayN.go`: This file contains the Go code with my solution to the day's challenge 🚀.
  - `dayN_test.go`: Accompanying tests for the solution, written following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology 🧪.
  - `input`: (If applicable) The input data for the challenge 📄.
- The project emphasizes clean code, Object-Oriented principles in Go, and tries to adhere to Go's best practices.

## Contributing and Feedback 🤝
